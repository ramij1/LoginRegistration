<p>We must understand the differences between JDK, JRE, and JVM before proceeding further to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial">Java</a>. See the brief overview of JVM here.</p>
<p>If you want to get the detailed knowledge of Java Virtual Machine, move to the next page. Firstly, let's see the differences between the JDK, JRE, and JVM.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="h3">JVM</h3>
<p>JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist. It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.</p>
<p>JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms. JVM, JRE, and JDK are platform dependent because the configuration of each&nbsp;<a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/os-tutorial">OS</a>&nbsp;is different from each other. However, Java is platform independent. There are three notions of the JVM:&nbsp;<em>specification</em>,&nbsp;<em>implementation</em>, and&nbsp;<em>instance</em>.</p>
<p>The JVM performs the following main tasks:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Loads code</li>
<li>Verifies code</li>
<li>Executes code</li>
<li>Provides runtime environment</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3 class="h3">JRE</h3>
<p>JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment. It is also written as Java RTE. The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.</p>
<p>The implementation of JVM is also actively released by other companies besides Sun Micro Systems.</p>

<hr />
<h3 class="h3">JDK</h3>
<p>JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/java-applet">applets</a>. It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools.</p>
<p>JDK is an implementation of any one of the below given Java Platforms released by Oracle Corporation:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Standard Edition Java Platform</li>
<li>Enterprise Edition Java Platform</li>
<li>Micro Edition Java Platform</li>
</ul>
<p>The JDK contains a private Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a few other resources such as an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), etc. to complete the development of a Java Application.</p>
